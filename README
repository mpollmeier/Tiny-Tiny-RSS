Style Fork
=============

This is a fork of the official Tiny Tiny RSS with some design alterations that reflect 
my personal taste and usability needs. It's not necessarily the best for everybody, 
but I've tried to clean up the UI a bit. Might be worth giving it a try for other people, so I'm sharing it here. 
Changes to the official TTRSS:
    * added a 'one click to article' shortlink in article description
    * moved the 'star' and 'add to feed' icons from the article header to the footer
    * don't show article excerpt in headline
    * reduced the number of colors used
